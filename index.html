  <h1><b>The Most Beautiful Creatures You Could Watch Forever</b></h1> 
</header>
<main>
<p>Did you know that some birds can sleep while flying or see colors that people can’t? I learned this recently, and now I notice birds even more. This morning, as I sat by my window , I saw a flock of birds flying across the bright sky. Their wings looked shiny in the sunlight, and their happy songs filled the air.
  One little sparrow landed near me and chirped before flying away again. Watching the birds made me feel calm and free, like I could fly too. Birds make the world more beautiful with their songs, their colors, and the way they move. They remind me that nature is full of life and wonder every day.
    If you're a casual garden birdwatcher like me here are some of the birds you'll most likely see. </p>
